- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fionntb

- I have just started learning to code. I chose Codecademy to learn how to do it and have started their beginner JS Course.

- I'm hoping to go into full stack development as a career and ideally work remotely, travelling around the America.

- I love running, Battlefield, The Office and arguing with people about things that shouldn't matter to me!

- I have no idea what I'm doing with any of this yet..
